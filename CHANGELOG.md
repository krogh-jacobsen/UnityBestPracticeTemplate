# Changelog

All notable changes to this package will be documented in this file.

The format is based on [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.0.0/),
and this package adheres to [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html).

## [1.4.4] - 2026-03-21
### Fixed
- **Agent Skills not visible in VS Code Copilot Chat** — copying agent skills to `.github/prompts/` now automatically adds `"chat.promptFiles": true` to `.vscode/settings.json`, which is the hidden opt-in setting required for `.prompt.md` files to appear as slash commands in Copilot Chat. The same setting is applied when copying individual skills via the dashboard `Add` button.

### Added
- **`FixVSCodeSlnx.IsChatPromptFilesEnabled`** — new public helper that checks whether `"chat.promptFiles"` is present in `.vscode/settings.json`.
- **`FixVSCodeSlnx.EnsureChatPromptFilesEnabled`** — new public helper that writes `"chat.promptFiles": true` to `.vscode/settings.json`, creating the file if it does not exist.
- **Dashboard status row** — the Agent Skills panel in the Project Dashboard now shows a `[Enabled]` / `[Disabled]` status indicator for `chat.promptFiles` with an inline **Enable** button so users can opt-in without running the full copy workflow.

## [1.4.3] - 2026-03-15
### Added
- **Unity MCP relay** — `ConfigureUnityMCP.cs` writes `UserSettings/mcp.json` to wire up the Unity MCP relay server; menu item `Tools → Unity Project Configurator → AI → Configure Unity MCP`; detects whether the relay binary is installed and whether the file already exists before writing
- **Fix VS Code .slnx** — `FixVSCodeSlnx.cs` resolves the "Active document not part of open workspace" error in VS Code by removing the OmniSharp preference and adding the C# Dev Kit extension recommendation; menu item `Tools → Unity Project Configurator → Fix VS Code .slnx`
- **PlayerPrefs Inspector** — `PlayerPrefsInspectorWindow.cs` lets you view, search, add, edit, and delete PlayerPrefs entries (String / Int / Float) without leaving the editor; menu item `Tools → Unity Project Configurator → Utilities → PlayerPrefs Inspector`
- **Layer Collision Matrix editor** — `LayerCollisionMatrixWindow.cs` renders the physics layer collision matrix as an editable triangular grid and saves/loads configurations to `LayerCollisionConfig` assets; menu item `Tools → Unity Project Configurator → Utilities → Layer Collision Matrix`

### Changed
- **Texture import presets consolidated** — reduced from 7 presets to 4 to match the recommended asset pipeline: `SingleSprite` + `SpriteAtlas` merged into `UISprite`; `Roughness` merged into `Mask`; `HDRI` removed; folder filters updated to `Assets/**/Textures/UI/**`, `Assets/**/Textures/Environment/Albedo/**`, `Assets/**/Textures/Environment/Normal/**`, and `Assets/**/Textures/Environment/Masks/**`
- **Copy AI Files to Project** — `CopyAIFilesToProject.cs` now copies LLM instruction files to `.github/instructions/*.instructions.md` (VS Code Copilot workspace instructions) and agent skill files to both `.github/prompts/*.prompt.md` (Copilot reusable prompts) and `.claude/commands/*.md` (Claude Code slash commands)

## [1.4.2] - 2026-03-14
### Added
- **? Explainer buttons** — every card in the Project Configuration panel now has a `?` button that opens a reusable `ExplainerWindow` popup with a description, folder/settings preview, and an optional "Run Now" action
- **Section dividers** — thin horizontal rules between dashboard panels improve visual separation without changing individual card layout

### Changed
- **Package renamed to Unity Project Configurator** — `displayName` updated to `Unity Project Configurator`; all menu items moved to `Tools/Unity Project Configurator/`; Create Asset menus updated from `Best Practices/` to `Project Configurator/`
- **Menu reorganisation** — all tools consolidated from the mixed `Window/Best Practices/` and `Tools/Unity Best Practices/` locations into a single `Tools/Unity Workbench/` hierarchy with submenus (`Setup`, `Code`, `Version Control`, `AI`, `Utilities`); `Open Dashboard` is pinned at the top (priority 1)
- **Import preset glob patterns** — preset folder filters no longer rely on the hardcoded `_ProjectName` root; patterns now use `Assets/**/<FolderName>/**` so they match the named folder at any depth regardless of project root name
- **Disable button colour** — the `Disable` button tint changed from saturated red `(0.9, 0.5, 0.5)` to a softer rose `(0.85, 0.65, 0.65)` to reduce visual noise

### Fixed
- **`CreateSubSystem` folder nesting** — `UI/UXML`, `UI/USS`, and `UI/Scripts` sub-system subfolders were passed as a single path string to `EditorController.CreateFolder`, causing Unity to create a flat `UI_UXML` folder; each component is now created with a separate `CreateFolder` call using the correct parent path

## [1.4.1] - 2026-03-13
### Added
- **Project Settings** — per-setting Disable/Reset toggle buttons let you revert individual settings without opening the settings window; `ConfigureProjectSettings` gains `DisableEnterPlayMode`, `DisableIncrementalGC`, `DisableCreateObjectsAtOrigin`, `DisableNewHierarchyWindow`, and `ResetAssetManagerImportLocation`
- **Project Settings** — each card description now uses an "Enabled: … / Disabled: …" format so the effect of toggling is always visible inline
- **Project Settings** — "Open" button replaced with "Settings" and routes to the correct Project Settings or Preferences panel per entry; file-linked buttons keep the "Open" label

### Fixed
- **Agent Skills / LLM Instructions** — presence detection was broken for local and registry packages because paths were resolved by string concatenation instead of `PackageInfo.FindForAssetPath`; `ProjectDashboardData` now stores a resolved `FullPath` on each file entry via `ResolveAssetPathToAbsolute()`
- **Agent Skills / LLM Instructions** — installed files now show `[Configured]`; the "Add" button is hidden once a file is installed; outdated files show `[Outdated]` with an "Update" button
- **Project Configuration** — `.gitignore`, `.gitattributes`, and `.editorconfig` cards now show `[Configured]` when the file exists (was `[OK]`)

## [1.4.0] - 2026-03-09
### Added
- `Editor/NewProjectWizard.cs` — **Window → Best Practices → New Project Wizard** opens a guided setup window that runs all 7 setup steps (folders, assembly definitions, import presets, tags & layers, .gitignore, .editorconfig, project settings) individually or all at once via "Run Full Setup"
- `Editor/ConfigureProjectSettings.cs` — **Window → Best Practices → Configure Project Settings** applies recommended Unity 6 project settings in one click: Enter Play Mode (DisableDomainReload + DisableSceneReload), IL2CPP scripting backend for Standalone/Android/iOS, and .NET Standard 2.1 API compatibility
- `Editor/Validator/ProjectSettingsValidator.cs` — new validator that checks whether Enter Play Mode optimisations are enabled and flags Mono scripting backend; results appear in the Project Dashboard validation details
- `ConfigurePresets.Execute()` — public entry point for the preset registration logic, allowing the wizard to call it without the confirmation dialog

### Fixed
- `ProjectDashboardWindow` — preset status display in Status Overview now correctly shows "Audio: OK / missing" and "Textures: OK / missing" for each preset type (previously all four branches displayed the same string due to stripped control characters)

### Changed
- `ProjectDashboardWindow` — header now shows the package version (read at runtime via `PackageInfo.FindForAssembly`); added shortcut button to open the New Project Wizard
- `ProjectDashboardWindow` — "Git" status row renamed to "Git & IDE" and now includes `.editorconfig` presence; reports "All configured" or lists what is missing
- `ProjectDashboardWindow` — validation details now show a green "[OK]" row for validators with zero issues, giving a complete pass/fail view of every validator
- `ProjectDashboardWindow` — window auto-refreshes on focus (`OnFocus`) so data stays current after running setup steps
- `ProjectDashboardData` — adds `HasEditorConfig` and `PackageVersion` fields; `GatherGitData` now checks for `.editorconfig`; `ProjectSettingsValidator` added to the validator list

## [1.3.3] - 2026-03-09
### Added
- `Editor/AgentSkills/` folder — agent skill prompt files for use with Claude Code and GitHub Copilot
- `UnityCodeReview.md` — skill that reviews C# code against `UnityCodeStyleInstructions.md` and `UnityPerformanceOptimizationInstructions.md`, producing a severity-rated issues table with a Pass/Fail verdict
- `UnityUIToolkitCreate.md` — skill for generating UI Toolkit UI (UXML + USS + C# View/Model/Presenter) following `UnityUIToolkitInstructions.md` conventions

### Changed
- `UnityDebuggingInstructions.md` — removed domain-specific sections (Input System, Animation, Audio, Performance, UI Toolkit debugging) now that they live in their respective domain files; added overview table pointing to each domain file
- `UnityInputSystemInstructions.md` — added Troubleshooting section (device connection, PlayerInput, Input Action debugging, common issues table)
- `UnityAnimationInstructions.md` — added Troubleshooting section (Animator state/parameter issues, Animation Events, Root Motion)
- `UnityAudioInstructions.md` — added Troubleshooting section (AudioSource, spatial audio, AudioMixer issues)
- `UnityPerformanceOptimizationInstructions.md` — added Troubleshooting section (diagnosing performance issues, Profiler setup, finding hidden allocations)
- `UnityProjectConfigurationInstructions.md` — added Version Control Settings and Script Compilation Settings sections, expanded TOC, added Troubleshooting section, corrected `applyTo` frontmatter scope, replaced hardcoded paths with general guidance

## [1.3.2] - 2026-03-04

  - **Folder Structure** — verifies all expected `_ProjectName` subfolders exist
  - **Import Presets** — verifies all expected `.preset` assets exist in the package
  - **LLM Instruction Files** — verifies all expected markdown instruction files exist
  - **Git & IDE Config** — checks for `.git` repo, `.gitignore`, and `.editorconfig`
  - **Project Health** — checks assembly definitions, Tags & Layers config, scenes in Build Settings, company/product name defaults, scripting backend, oversized textures (>2048px), and uncompressed audio (PCM/ADPCM)
- `Editor/Dashboard/ProjectDashboardWindow.cs` — `EditorWindow` rendering all sections with colour-coded status icons, per-section action buttons, and a summary banner; open via **Window → Best Practices → Project Dashboard** or **Shift+Alt+D**

## [1.3.1] - 2026-03-04
### Added
- `ProjectDashboardWindow.cs` — **Window → Best Practices → Project Dashboard** opens a single EditorWindow showing the health of the entire project at a glance
- `ProjectDashboardData.cs` — stateless data collector that drives the dashboard; checks are separated from rendering following single responsibility
- **Folder Structure** section — shows which expected `_ProjectName` folders exist vs are missing, with a one-click "Setup Project Folders" button
- **Import Presets** section — verifies each expected `.preset` asset exists in the package, with a one-click "Configure Import Presets" button
- **LLM Instruction Files** section — checks all expected instruction markdown files are present in the package

- **Project Health** section — checks assembly definitions, Tags & Layers config, scenes in Build Settings, company/product name defaults, and scripting backend; includes buttons to open Player Settings and Build Settings
- Summary banner at the top of the window showing total error and warning counts across all sections

## [1.3.0] - 2026-03-04
### Added
- `ProjectTagsAndLayers.cs` — ScriptableObject config for defining custom tags, sorting layers, and physics layers (create via **Assets → Create → Best Practices → Project Tags and Layers**)
- `SetupTagsAndLayers.cs` — **Window → Best Practices → Setup Tags and Layers** reads the config and registers entries into `TagManager.asset`, preserving existing entries
- Default config ships with common game-development tags (`Player`, `Enemy`, `NPC`, `Projectile`, `Pickup`, `Interactable`, `Checkpoint`, `SpawnPoint`, `Trigger`), sorting layers (`Background`, `Environment`, `Props`, `Characters`, `Foreground`, `UI`, `Overlay`), and physics layers (`Player`, `Enemy`, `NPC`, `Projectile`, `Pickup`, `Interactable`, `Ground`, `Environment`, `Trigger`, `Ragdoll`)

## [1.2.0] - 2026-03-04
### Added
- `GenerateEditorConfig.cs` — **Window → Best Practices → Generate .editorconfig** creates an `.editorconfig` at the project root enforcing the package's C# naming conventions, formatting rules, and code style preferences for Rider, Visual Studio, and VS Code
- `GenerateGitIgnore.cs` — **Window → Best Practices → Generate .gitignore** creates a Unity-optimised `.gitignore` at the project root excluding Library, Temp, Logs, IDE files, OS metadata, and build artifacts
- `GenerateAssemblyDefinitions.cs` — **Window → Best Practices → Generate Assembly Definitions** scaffolds `.asmdef` files in Scripts, Editor, Tests/Runtime, and Tests/Editor using `CompanyName.ProductName` as the root namespace
- `SetupProjectFolders.cs` — extracted folder scaffolding into its own file from `EditorController.cs`
- `UI/Sprites` and `UI/Sprites/Atlas` folders — UI sprite assets now live under `UI/` rather than `Art/Textures/UI/`
- Texture subfolder creation (`Albedo`, `Normal`, `Roughness`, `Mask`, `HDRI`) to match preset filter paths
- Tests folder creation (`Tests/Runtime`, `Tests/Editor`) in folder scaffolding

### Changed
- Refactored `EditorController.cs` to follow single responsibility — generator logic extracted into `SetupProjectFolders.cs`, `GenerateEditorConfig.cs`, `GenerateGitIgnore.cs`, and `GenerateAssemblyDefinitions.cs`
- `EditorController.CreateFolder` is now `public` so it can be shared across generator classes
- Moved UI sprite preset glob filters from `Assets/_ProjectName/Art/Textures/UI/` to `Assets/_ProjectName/UI/Sprites/`
- All preset glob paths in `ConfigurePresets.cs` now consistently use the `Assets/_ProjectName/` prefix
- Updated `readme.md` with comprehensive documentation: Quick Start steps, folder structure diagram, preset tables, installation instructions, troubleshooting guide, and contributing section
